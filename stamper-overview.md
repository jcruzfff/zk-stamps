Updated Implementation Plan with RainbowKit (Celo + Self Protocol)
Since RainbowKit is supported on Celo, you can now leverage Coinbase Wallet and other wallets while keeping Self Protocol for ZK Proofs. Here’s the revised plan incorporating RainbowKit for wallet authentication.

ONLY USE REAL TRANSACTION BLOCKCHAIN DATA. NEVER USE MOCKDATA

📌 Core Features
Wallet Connection via RainbowKit

Users can connect using Coinbase Wallet, Valora, Brave Wallet, WalletConnect, etc.
The dApp supports Celo mainnet & testnets (Alfajores, Baklava).
Once connected, users can scan their passport for verification.
Passport Verification (ZKP)

Users scan their passport’s NFC chip via the dApp.
A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is generated via Self Protocol.
Users choose what details to disclose (age, nationality, etc.).
The proof is sent to the dApp to verify: ✅ Real Human?
✅ From EU?
✅ Above 18?
✅ Not on OFAC List?
Travel Verification (NFC + GPS)

When users enter a new country, they scan their passport again.
The app checks GPS coordinates against the last recorded location.
If a new country is detected:
✅ A ZK-proof of travel is created.
✅ The system mints and sends a new POAP to the user.
POAP Collection & Sharing

Users view their POAPs on a dynamic world map.
Clicking a POAP reveals:
Verified country visited.
Date & time of verification.
Travel ZK-proof details.
Users can share POAPs on social media.

🔄 Implementation Steps
1️⃣ Wallet Connection (RainbowKit)
User Flow:

User opens dApp and connects wallet via RainbowKit.
Supported wallets:
Coinbase Wallet
Valora
Brave Wallet
WalletConnect
Once connected, the app displays passport verification prompt.
📌 Tools Used:

RainbowKit (for wallet UI + authentication).
Wagmi & Viem (for blockchain interactions on Celo).
Celo Network RPCs (for reading/writing to smart contracts).
2️⃣ Passport Verification (ZK Proof)
User Flow:

User scans their passport NFC chip using the mobile dApp.
App uses Self Protocol to extract details without exposing private info.
The system generates a ZK Proof confirming:
✅ Real human (Passport is valid)
✅ From EU (If required)
✅ Above 18 (Birthdate check)
✅ Not on OFAC list (Sanction check)
Users choose what details to share (Privacy-preserving).
The proof is sent to the Celo smart contract for validation.
📌 Tools Used:

SelfQRcodeWrapper (for scanning passport & generating ZK proofs).
SelfBackendVerifier (for backend verification of the proof).
Celo smart contract (for storing the attestation of verified users).
3️⃣ Travel Verification (NFC + GPS Scan)
User Flow:

When users enter a new country, they are prompted:
🛂 “Scan your passport to log travel & earn a POAP!”
The app reads the passport’s NFC again.
The current GPS location is checked.
If the new location differs from the last country:
✅ A new ZK-proof of travel is generated.
✅ The dApp issues a new POAP to the user.
✅ Data is stored on-chain to track their travel history.
📌 Tools Used:

GPS API (for location tracking).
Self Protocol (for verifying passport identity).
Celo Smart Contract (to mint the POAP).
4️⃣ POAP Minting & Collection
User Flow:

Users open the POAP Collection page in the app.
They see:
A world map with visited countries highlighted.
Their POAP collection (sorted by date or country).
Clicking a POAP reveals:
✅ Country visited
✅ Verification proof
✅ Transaction details
Users can share their POAPs via social media.
📌 Tools Used:

React Native Map (for interactive POAP world map).
Celo Smart Contract (for tracking earned POAPs).
IPFS/Arweave (to store metadata for each POAP).
